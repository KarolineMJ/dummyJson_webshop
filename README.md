## Welcome

Hi there! And welcome to my webshop!
I chose to build the webshop with `react` and `nextjs` - have fun exploring!

## Pre running

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- `Node.js` _min version 20_
- `npmÂ´ or another package manager

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
