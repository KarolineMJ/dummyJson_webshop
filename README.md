## Welcome

Hi there! And welcome to my webshop!
I chose to build the webshop with `react` and `nextjs` - have fun exploring!

## Pre running

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- `Node.js` _min version 20_
- `npm` or another package manager

## Getting Started

Make sure to install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Application Flow

1. User navigates to a page with available products shown with an image, title, price and availability.
   - Limit the number of shown articles and lazy load or paginate
2. User can search for products, product categories, etc. to limit the products shown on the page
3. User can sort based on eg. price, availability, discount
4. User can click on the product card to get more information about the product
5. The user can select to add products to the cart
6. The user can show the content of the cart and remove products from it

**My features:**

7. The user can increase the quantity of an item directly from the cart
8. The user can change the amount of products shown per page
9. The user can always rearrange the data in ascending or descending order
